# Graphology Using Machine Learning

**Preview:** https://graphology.navanchauhan.now.sh ( CI Deployment using Zeit Now )
Graphology is the study of human personality through writing. It is a projective personality test, that let us know diverse personality traits.
This repo is an effort to use Machine Learning to do an analysis using fixed rules of graphology. A more detailed log and explanation about this project is [here](https://github.com/jesusmartinoza/Graphology-ML/blob/master/Report.pdf)
